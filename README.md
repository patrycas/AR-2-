# AR(2)
In this example we will see the analysis of AR (2) using MATLAB. For that, From the Shillers webpage download "U.S. Stock Markets 1871-Present and CAPE Ratio" and take the stock price index (column B), then we need to import the data of the following form:\\
                             
                             ####stock_price= xlsread('data.xlsxâ€™,'Data','B: B')\\

After loading the data, we begin the analysis of AR (2). Something very important before the analysis, we should know if the process is causal and stationary.
